<h2 id="just-finished-three-papers"><a href="#just-finished-three-papers">#</a> just finished three papers!</h2>
<p>I had three paper submissions from February 4-12th. It was a big
crunch but with the help of many collaborators we were able to get all
submitted. Since then I bought a guitar and have mostly been playing
that. Eventually I will start doing research again.</p>

<h2 id="taing"><a href="#taing">#</a> TAing</h2>
<p>I’m currently TAing Intro to Cryptography (CMSC 28400), taught by <a
href="https://aloni.net">Aloni Cohen</a>. My office hours are
Wednesdays, 10am-12pm and 2-4pm at JCL 207.</p>

<h2 id="on-my-mind"><a href="#on-my-mind">#</a> on my mind</h2>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how research projects tend to fall
into three consecutive phases.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Study/Exploration</strong>: You are just learning about the
area, trying to develop intuition and learn techniques. This can take a
long time, and sometimes you explore for a while and ultimately realize
there is no path towards interesting results.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Now you have a lot of intuition for the
area and can prove things! This is a very exciting interval, but often
short (or you get stuck here and it never ends, until you decide to give
up).</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: You’ve basically determined your
results but are trying to figure out how to communicate it —
organizing/simplifying results, writing the paper, developing talks,
etc. This phase always takes longer than I think, but I really enjoy it.
It’s interesting to see how the act of communicating can help you refine
the results themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>For my own sanity, it’s helpful to keep track of the states of my
various projects:</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> * <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11993v1">The BUD Walk</a> *
Average-case hardness of LCIS * RSE bounds/constructions * 10x10
enumeration (on hold)</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> *Impeaching “mayors” of universal covers
(gave up for now)</p>
<p><strong>Study/Exploration</strong> * ReCom on dense random graphs *
Algorithms for planted subgraph * Prophet inequalities with cancellation
costs * AI and the Fourth Amendment * Actuarially fair insurance pricing
(on hold) * Distinguishing permutations from functions (on hold) * Job
scheduling lower bound (on hold)</p>

<h2 id="big-tcs-questions"><a href="#big-tcs-questions">#</a> big (TCS) questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Given that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17360">the low-degree
conjecture is false</a>, how can we build a good theory of average-case
hardness?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/Papers/meta-alg.pdf">Is structure
necessary for public-key cryptography?</a></li>
