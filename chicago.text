## theater 
There's so much good theater and comedy in the city. Below are some venues that consistently put on good stuff.

* [The Annoyance](https://www.theannoyance.com/shows). Lakeview East, off of the Belmont Red Line. Good, weird improv comedy.
* [iO Theater](https://ioimprov.com/). Off of the North/Clybourn Red Line stop. Good improv comedy, tends to be less weird than the Annoyance.
* [Neo-Futurists](https://neofuturists.org/). Andersonville. Experimental Theater. Go to [The Infinite Wrench](https://theneofuturists.my.salesforce-sites.com/ticket/#/events/a0SUn0000017z1NMAQ).
* [Court Theater](https://www.courttheatre.org/season-tickets/subscriptions/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw0t63BhAUEiwA5xP54XHtAwe3_K_g3OHSPAKA70AyzEVp8saThQT8jE5ysBCCOCoEQhmq4hoC1K0QAvD_BwE) Hyde Park.

## jazz
Lots of good jazz clubs. I've never had a good time at the Green Mill Lounge, but let me know if you have because maybe I'm missing something. Some favorites:

* [Jazz Showcase](https://www.jazzshowcase.com/). South Loop. Great couches.
* [Kingston Mines](https://www.kingstonmines.com/?v=7516fd43adaa). Lincoln Park. Very good blues club, high energy. Go after midnight!
