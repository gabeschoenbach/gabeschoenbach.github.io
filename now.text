## on my mind
Next week, I'm looking forward to attending an AIM workshop at Caltech on [sampling connected balanced graph partitions](https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/connectedbalanced/). I'll be spending the summer thinking about graph partitions, range-searchable encryption, and ORAM schemes.
