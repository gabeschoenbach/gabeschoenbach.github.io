## on my mind
I'm in Boston (again). What a nice, walkable little town! Also the new BU building for Data Science, Computer Science, Math, and Statistics is maybe the most beautiful building I've ever worked in.

## upcoming travel
(default: Hyde Park, Chicago)

* Boston, MA: August 16-23 [MGGG Redistricting Lab Summer Program](https://www.mggg.org)
