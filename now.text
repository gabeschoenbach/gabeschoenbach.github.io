## on my mind
Our paper on [watermarking language models for many adaptive users](https://ia.cr/2024/759) just got accepted to the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy! Joint work with [Aloni](aloni.net) and [Alex](axhoover.com), we extend definitions for watermarking language models and present the first black-box reductions between existing schemes.

This quarter I'm TAing Intro to Cryptography and taking a class on Operating Systems. Looking forward to re-learning enough crypto to teach it and being able to understand some tiny bit about how computers actually work, respectively.

## theory lunch
I am organizing the [UChicago CS Theory Group](http://theory.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php)'s weekly theory lunch seminar. We still have some openings in October and November -- please reach out to me if you would like to give a 30-minute presentation! 

## running the marathon
I got the last-minute opportunity to run the Chicago Marathon, so am in the middle of a quick four-week training cycle to get in shape. Only partially set back by a poorly-timed stomach bug. I will NOT race the marathon for time, I tell myself again and again, borne back ceaselessly into my past D3 collegiate running days.
