## on my mind
I am at [IEEE S&P](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/) presenting my work on [watermarking the outputs of language models](https://ia.cr/2024/759), which is joint work with [Aloni Cohen](aloni.net) and [Alex Hoover](axhoover.com). Come say hi!

In June, I'm looking forward to attending an AIM workshop on [sampling connected balanced graph partitions](https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/connectedbalanced/) in Pasadena. This quarter I'm TAing Advanced Algorithms, a Masters' course taught by [Gerry Brady](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gerry-brady/). 

## office hours
My office hours for MPCS 55005 -- Advanced Algorithms -- are on Thursdays, from 12:30-2:00pm in JCL 207.
