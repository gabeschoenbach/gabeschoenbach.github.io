### what am i up to? 
[go back ↰](http://gabey.zip)

## on my mind
Back from a busy month of traveling to two back-to-back conferences ([FORC](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/) and [FAccT](https://facctconference.org/2023/schedule.html)) and then a week at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab Summer Program](https://www.mggg.org). I'm excited to settle into my Chicago summer routine, looking forward to working through more of my reading list. I'd love to learn some spectral graph theory. Plus some camping if I play my cards right....
