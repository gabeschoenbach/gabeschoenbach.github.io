## discrete math
I'm TAing [Discrete Mathematics (CMSC 27100)](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~davidcash/271-autumn-25/index.html) this quarter, really enjoying teaching students how to write proofs! 

## on my mind
I've been thinking a lot about how research projects tend to fall into three consecutive phases. 

1. **Study/Exploration**: You are just learning about the area, trying to develop intuition and learn techniques. This can take a long time, and sometimes you explore for a while and ultimately realize there is no path towards interesting results. 
2. **Discovery**: Now you have a lot of intuition for the area and can prove things! This is a very exciting interval, but often short (or you get stuck here and it never ends, until you decide to give up). 
3. **Communication**: You've basically determined your results but are trying to figure out how to communicate it --- paper-writing, developing talks, etc. This phase always takes longer than I think, but I really enjoy it. It's interesting to see how the act of communicating can help you refine the results themselves.

With these phases in mind, here are the states of my various projects:

* Optimization in random graphs: communication
* Multidimensional range-searchable encryption: discovery/communication
* Redistricting - irreducibility: discovery
* Redistricting - enumeration: exploration/discovery 
* Redistricting - mixing times: exploration
* Actuarially fair insurance pricing: exploration (on hold)
* Job scheduling lower bound: exploration (on hold)
* Impeaching "mayors" of universal covers: discovery (gave up for now)

## big (TCS) questions
* [Is structure necessary for public-key cryptography?](https://www.boazbarak.org/Papers/meta-alg.pdf)

## worried about things
Like ICE in Chicago, the CTA getting defunded, etc etc.
