### what am i up to? 
[go back â†°](https://gabey.zip)

## on my mind
I just got back from the [DIMACS Tutorial on Fine-Grained Complexity Theory](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/details?eID=2764) at Rutgers University. Met a lot of great researchers as we learned about fine-grained reductions and how to separate different polynomial-time problems! Last month, I submitted my [first paper](https://ia.cr/2024/759) of the PhD, a joint work with [Aloni Cohen](aloni.net) and [Alex Hoover](axhoover.com) that extends definitions for watermarking language models and presents the first black-box reductions between existing schemes. I also just moved up to Buena Park with my friend [Jake](https://jaketg97.github.io/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/).

## theory lunch
I am organizing the [UChicago CS Theory Group](http://theory.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php)'s weekly theory lunch seminar. We'll be starting back up again in the fall; please reach out to me if you would like to give a 30-minute presentation!
