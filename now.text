## on my mind
Excited about summer in Chicago! Have a [long list of papers](https://gabeschoenbach.com/research.html#reading-list) I'd like to read. Trying to prove or disprove something about the composition of deletion-compliant data controllers (like [Theorem 7.4 here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07876.pdf)). Hoping to practice more electric bass, hang out with my kittens and my friends, etc.
