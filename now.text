No classes. One improv group. 1.5 research projects. Two cats. This summer I'll be moving up to the north side with my friend [Jake](https://jaketg97.github.io/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/).

## theory lunch
I am organizing the [UChicago CS Theory Group](http://theory.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php)'s weekly theory lunch seminar. Please reach out to me if you would like to give a 30-minute presentation!
