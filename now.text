## on my mind
After getting back from a busy month of traveling to two back-to-back conferences ([FORC](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/) and [FAccT](https://facctconference.org/2023/schedule.html)) and then a week at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab Summer Program](https://www.mggg.org), I've finally settled into my summer routine. I'm working through my [reading list](https://gabey.zip/research.html#reading-list). I'd also like to learn some [spectral graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory).

## upcoming travel
