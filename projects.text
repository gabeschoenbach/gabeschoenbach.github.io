## gerrychain 
Before I started my PhD, I was an active contributor to [GerryChain](https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain), a Python library that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to build ensembles of political districting plans. In particular, I worked on fine-tuning local search techniques, and added county and municipality awareness to our Markov chains. GerryChain has been used extensively in recent legal cases concerning partisan and racial gerrymandering. In particular, it was used in [Allen v. Milligan](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/), where the Supreme Court struck down Alabama's Congressional districting plan for violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

## pyei 
Developed in collaboration with [Dr. Karin C. Knudson](https://karinknudson.com/) and [Dr. Amy Becker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amariah-becker-90225980/), [PyEI](https://github.com/mggg/ecological-inference) is a Python package for ecological inference and ecological regression. We developed this tool with two goals in mind:

* To improve the sophistication with which legal experts can discuss evidence of RPV in voting rights cases.
* To make it easier for researchers to explore the sometimes-murky behavior of EI models. 

In conjunction with GerryChain, PyEI has been used in several legal cases after the 2020 redistricting cycle, including [Allen v. Milligan](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/).
