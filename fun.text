## improv
I joined an [improv team](https://www.instagram.com/bridaldartyimprov/)! Our name is Bridal Darty and we had our first show at [iO Theater](https://ioimprov.com/) in February.

## winnie.boo
I made Audrey [a website](https://winnie.boo) for her birthday. Other than this one, I haven't built a website since [2008](http://flickistan.com), and it's been cool to see how the technology has changed. I didn't want to use any heavyweight frameworks, and was floored by how helpful [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) was in helping me build it -- just with HTML, CSS, and a few JavaScript functions.
