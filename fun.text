## winnie.boo
I made my girlfriend [a website](https://winnie.boo) for her birthday. Other than this one, I haven't built a website since [2008](http://flickistan.com), and it's been cool to see how the technology has changed. I didn't want to use any heavyweight frameworks, and was floored by how helpful [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) was in helping me build it -- just with HTML, CSS, and a few JavaScript functions.
