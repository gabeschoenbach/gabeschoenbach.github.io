### about me

## quick stuff 
I grew up in Glen Ellen, California, in the heart of Sonoma Valley. I like to rock climb and run on the Chicago lakefront, though I miss exploring the mountains back home. I come from a family of musicians and enjoy playing the piano and the electric bass. I'm obsessed with making the dumbest possible jokes, as frequently as my friends will allow.

I'm a [first-year PhD student](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/) in the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, advised by [Aloni Cohen](https://aloni.net). I'm interested in using theoretical computer science to tackle problems in civic life, with an eye towards legal and policy applications. 

## research
I'm trying to read widely and figure out what sorts of problems appeal to me — I like thinking about questions that are easy to state and hard to solve. I've also been interested in the intersection between theoretical computer science and legal theory. Lately, I've been really inspired by many of the papers from [FORC](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/). I like thinking about [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) and [partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set), all of which stem from my work in [computational redistricting](https://mggg.org/gerrybook.html). I'm trying to work through Spielman's [Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sagt/sagt.pdf) textbook, and am also getting interested in steganography and watermarking for large language models.

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab](https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/) at Tufts University, working with [Dr. Moon Duchin](https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/) to connect the academic study of computational redistricting with real-world applications. Many of my past papers and projects stem from that work.

## this site
I'm shamelessly copying [Kunal Marwaha](https://www.kunalmarwaha.com)'s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be natural to host online.
