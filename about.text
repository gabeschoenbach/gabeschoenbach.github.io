### about me
[go back ↰](https://gabey.zip)

## quick stuff 
I'm a [fourth-year PhD student](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/) in the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, advised by [Aloni Cohen](https://aloni.net). I'm generally interested in discrete mathematics. Before my PhD, I spent two years at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab](https://mggg.org), working with [Moon Duchin](https://mggg.org/people/mduchin) to connect the academic study of [computational redistricting](https://mggg.org/gerrybook.html) with real-world applications.
 
I grew up in Glen Ellen, California and greatly miss the trails, mountains, and wildlife back home. But I love exploring the many neighborhoods of Chicago, running and biking the lakefront, and seeing live performances around the city. I'm obsessed with making the dumbest jokes possible, as frequently as my friends will allow.

## research
I like thinking about questions that are easy to state and hard to solve. Problems that catch my interest tend to involve [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) (especially combinatorial questions about random graphs, [grid graphs](https://mggg.org/table.html), or [trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11993)) or have a civic/social application (e.g., [fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11529) in [political](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06930) [redistricting](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03397.pdf), [responsible use of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11109)). Methodologically, I like using cryptography to build protocols that enjoy provable security guarantees, and am interested in Markov chains and impossibility results.

## this site
I'm shamelessly copying [Kunal Marwaha](https://www.kunalmarwaha.com)'s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be natural to host online.
