### about me
[go back â†°](https://gabey.zip)

## quick stuff 
I'm a [third-year PhD student](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/) in the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, advised by [Aloni Cohen](https://aloni.net). I'm a theoretician interested in cryptography, combinatorics, and graph theory.  
 
I grew up in Glen Ellen, California and greatly miss the trails, mountains, and wildlife back home. But I love exploring the many neighborhoods of Chicago, running and biking the lakefront, and seeing live performances around the city. I'm obsessed with making the dumbest possible jokes, as frequently as my friends will allow.

## research
I like thinking about questions that are easy to state and hard to solve. Combinatorial problems with applications in cryptography are especially exciting. I'm currently interested in [searchable encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchable_symmetric_encryption), proofs of space, and [watermarking the outputs of language models](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/759). 

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab](https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/) at Tufts University, working with [Moon Duchin](https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/) to connect the academic study of [computational redistricting](https://mggg.org/gerrybook.html) with real-world applications. Many of my past papers and projects stem from that work, and I remain quite interested in combinatorial problems about trees and graph partitions.

## this site
I'm shamelessly copying [Kunal Marwaha](https://www.kunalmarwaha.com)'s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be natural to host online.
