<p>in midwinter the half-moon rises low in the east, we claim. to see
this, note the steady shaft of light cast crosswise along the floor.
little shadows flitting ghostlike under our feet. suppose not, that the
waning Christos peaked over that old cemetery. that we would live on the
outskirts of town, past the ponds and quiet oaks. but you hear that
insistent rumble, southbound, a city’s uninspired attempt at midnight
wind through old redwoods. and so we’re done.</p>

<p>I wake up early feeling. the heat of the sun bleeding through my
forest-green curtains. stretching myself out over flannel bedsheets. the
crackling of the corner radiator, drying out folded towels and my upper
lip.</p>
<p>Sunlight floods through my tiny treehouse and brings with it
indulgence. Montrose and Magnolia. Letters and numbers. The beginning of
26, the end of 27. I’m practicing living with calloused fingers and
lactic muscles. Call me the moment you get this.</p>

<p>he used to have a little office, down the hill. rented it out from mr
burns, glen ellen’s own small-town CPA, and often escape there, beyond
the controlled chaos of our chauvet-road shangri-la. he would walk: a
half mile down london ranch, left on arnold, over the bridge, past the
creek, past the United States Post Office, whose eagle logo i mistook
for a vacuum-cleaning alien for so many years.</p>
<p>i remember the office. the building. the peaked ceiling, exposed
wooden beams running along the spine of the roof. walking along the
hallway to a spartan kitchen, a yellowish glow streaming in through the
west-facing windows. you could see dust particles dance along a lazy
sunny beam. his office was spare. two desks, chairs, a whiteboard, his
Dell Latitude D610.</p>
<p>one summer, he paid me. $10 dollars an hour, and i would walk down
the hill on my own to meet him at his office. i would sit at the other
desk with my own laptop and help him put numbers into his spreadsheets.
or he would read out numbers and i would type them in. it was too clunky
for one person to do alone.</p>
<p>he used to tell me about my grandfather, his uncanny vision. how he
said one day, we would all buy things from our homes; somehow the
shopping malls would fit inside of computers the size of xerox
machines.</p>

<p>standing in the Sudbury air<br />
watching the dog sway precipitously on his feet<br />
I wonder vaguely why it is that old dogs don’t look <em>that</em>

<p>sure, they look old, but<br />
have you ever seen a 94-year-old Jewish Zaide<br />

<p>I tell my dad that I won’t be able to be ready at 10:15, but that I
could be by 10:25. He doesn’t hear me: “You’re saying something about
fencing?” No, I say — you had asked me to be ready to leave by 10:15,
and packing is taking longer than I expected, so I’ll need another 10
minutes. Fine, he says.</p>
<p>I go back to the bedroom, past the whiteboard with 13-month-old
definitions of fingerprinting codes. For the theory lunch presentation
about which Aloni told me “Nice job!”. My dad hadn’t erased them since
last Thanksgiving, when I somehow carved out an hour to nervously
prepare. I roll up my salmon-colored Uniqlo sweater into a perfect
cylinder and wrestle it into the last empty space in my backpack.</p>
<p>“Gabriel Schoenbach is it alright with you if you sit up front next
to David?” My sister asks. Yup.</p>
<p>Dad is driving faster than he normally does. We’re on Highway 12,
Highway 37, 101. I’m balancing a plate on my lap, with one small piece
of apple cake on it, covered with a layer of Saran Wrap. And a fork. Mom
asks if we can turn the heat on and Dad and I both reach out towards the
center console. I let him turn the dials. The roads are empty and we
drive in silence.</p>
<p>There’s always exactly one spot left, my dad marvels, as we pull into
the parking lot. I point out the empty spot diagonally across from ours,
but he thinks that one is for staff. “Gabriel and David will you please
walk ahead of me?” asks Maris.</p>
<p>Two white-haired women sit, heads bowed, in matching wheelchairs at
the end of the hallway, near a cafeteria. One of them is my grandmother.
She sees us and forms her mouth in a nearly perfect “O” of surprise, her
eyebrows raised. Like the emoji, I think. It looks like she’s pretending
to be taken aback at our arrival. I wonder if she is.</p>
<p>We wheel Carrie across the building to the library. I think about how
this must feel like we’re going across town. An upright piano in one
corner of the room. Do you remember playing RummiKub with me here, I ask
her. She raises her eyebrows again and nods slowly, unconvincingly. As
if I’ve expressed a mildly distasteful opinion, but she doesn’t want to
press the point.</p>
<p>“Can I walk around,” asks Maris, and my mom says yes of course. The
three of us will sit here and talk to Grandma Carrie. We do. There is a
lot of love in my grandmother’s eyes. My dad carves off one small piece
of the apple cake and passes it to her. She laboriously takes the piece,
breaks it apart into halves, and tries one small bite. We wait. She
gives my dad a thumbs down and he throws his head back to laugh and
laugh, eyes shut and his whole face screwed up tight. He looks like her.
I look like him.</p>
<p>Is this a new piano, my mom asks nobody in particular, as she sits
down and starts to play. One of Bach’s Preludes. The third one, in C#
Major. He was showing off how well-tempered the clavier was, that you
could make music in all twenty-four modes. Or maybe he was giving his
many students practice material, so they could accustom their hands and
fingers to all twelve keys. Either way, it made for the perfect ironic
backdrop to finish out my mother’s sets at the piano bars across Ann
Arbor, and later too, as she would tell stories of working those bars,
the words tumbling out of her mouth just as fast as her fingers could
flutter. That was how I first heard it.</p>
<p>Today I hear every missed note. She improvises a new ending and moves
on, to the Romanian folk dances, the Jazz standards, Bossa Nova,
Christmas. I watch as nurses float in, buoyed by the music. My
grandmother closes her eyes. My sister plugs her ears.</p>
<hr />
<p>My dad makes sure to drive in the rightmost lane as we leave the
Robin Williams tunnel; it’s the best view of the city. On a clear day
you can probably see three bridges. We’re winding our way down a San
Francisco hill as he smiles, “I can’t believe she gave me a thumbs down.
It must be the dementia.” We promise not to tell his sister, at least
until she tries her share of the cake.</p>
<p>My aunts have gotten rid of more than a carful of books, they tell
me. They’re trying to minimalize but their apartment is still full of
them. We want to be like gay men, they laugh — everything in straight
lines, nothing out of place. I look around. Isn’t it already like that,
I almost say. Instead I look longingly at their complete set of
Ottolenghi cookbooks. Ruthie makes me take a picture of the recipe for a
prawn, scallop, and clam dish. With feta. My dad feels strongly that
fish are categorically different from shellfish. I think he’s got the
Talmud on his side.</p>
<p>I fall asleep on their yellow couch. I remember the weekend Helena
and I house-sat for them, got to pretend we lived in a fancy two-bedroom
in Cole Valley. When my hair was so long we could tie it up with her
hairtie, and my nose bled thickly as we lay in the Mission Dolores
grass. I wake up hearing my mom marvel at Lynn’s office, how many books
she has, stacked to the ceiling. About nuclear war, most of them.</p>
<p>“I feel at peace,” my sister says, as we get to Terminal 2. Me too, I
agree. “May I please use the bathroom,” she adds, and my parents let her
go into the airport alone. I hug them with my too-heavy backpack already
on, caught off-balance by the strength of my desire to remember this
moment, every detail. There is a lot of love in my parents’ eyes. I turn
and walk through the sliding glass doors, and wonder if Maris has found
the bathroom okay.</p>

<p>I was in West County the first time I stayed up until midnight. In
West County, the land of native Californians, of dappled sunlight, of
wood-paneled villages growing sleepily amidst the trees. There are wood
nymphs, there.</p>
<p>I could have craned my neck up, way up, looking past the ancient
redwoods, their trunks and canopies, to the stunningly clear sky above.
To see the faded white stripe of Milky Way stars. To breathe in the
saltwater musk, to feel the bite of Pacific cold in the sighing air.</p>
<p>Instead, I sat in the passenger seat of our royal-green Volvo S70,
Glue. So-named for the smell, Maris had claimed, but I was more taken by
the comfort of the leather seats. Other nights, I had succumbed to sleep
before we made it home, keeping my eyes closed even after we had wound
our way up our quarter-mile driveway, so Dad would carry me out, into
the house, up the stairs, to my irregular room.</p>
<p>Tonight, I waited. Dad was still in John’s house. I imagined them
both clearing a space to sit, to talk; gingerly moving aside teetering
stacks of books, faded envelopes and past-due bills. Disassembled VCRs.
A thin layer of dust over every surface, warmed by the orange-yellow
glow of so many beautiful candles.</p>
<p>I loved my watch; I loved the cool weight of it on my left wrist, how
each of the four buttons would beep upon press. How, with it, I could
measure Time. I remember laying flat on the big rug in my parents’
bedroom, pressing the bottom-right mode button, then the top-right
multipurpose one. Watching the stopwatch seconds relentlessly tick
upwards. Learning five minutes through practice, by feel.</p>
<p>The silence breaks, in that West County clearing, as I squeeze the
top-left button of my watch. The aqua-green backlight floods my eyes,
and I blink quickly to see 11:59. To watch the seconds tick upwards. I
catch my breath, overcome by a strange expansive feeling, one that
heretofore had been unknown to my eight-year-old self. One that I will
not catch again for years. The expanse spreads from my chest to my
fingers, my temples, filling the interior of the Volvo Sedan. My last
cold breath still hanging, visible, in the air. Out there, an owl hoots.
It is midnight. The trees are still.</p>
<p>Dad comes back, and then we wind our way home.</p>

<p>On cold nights in December, we would meet at the high school parking
lot, ten cars deep. And then we’d caravan, turning right out of the
school, a mile down Montecito, left on Mission towards Somerfield Lane,
till we got to Parktrail. A dozen nervous cross country nerds, piling
out of the cars, taking off. Manzanita trees neatly threaded through
with casual wordplay, borne from thousands of miles on the same stunning
mountain. Go deep into Annadel State Park. Hang a right on the fire road
and head three miles southeast, winding yourself up Spring Creek’s
insistent climb. Dark red dirt streaking across ankles. Quick, short
breaths.</p>
<p>We made it up to Lake Ilsanjo to see the deep moon loft itself above
sillouhetted oaks. Orange-yellow reflection shimmering above quiet
water. We threw our running shorts in a haphazard heap on that first
picnic table, everything off except shoes and PR socks. Howls echoed
across the silent meadow. A field of dry grass rustling softly under
that now quicksilver moon. And then we <em>ran</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Every December 21, I’d stay over at Rowan’s. We’d get up so early it
still felt late, pile into Martina’s Volvo stationwagon and head 20
minutes north up Highway 12, hoping to get to Sugarloaf Ridge with more
than an hour before sunrise. We’d run up the moutain, screetching to a
halt only if we came upon a thin puddle — chance there would be rare ice
over the surface.</p>
<p>I have no memory of summitting the mountain. Only running back down,
color slowly returning to the world as the slow winter sun rose behind
us. Dashing to our picnic table by the car, rabid for steamed milk with
hastily mixed-in chocolate powder. Solstice.</p>

<p>I used to write a lot when I was little. I would pace around the
carpeted floors of 1263 Chauvet Road, the big, cool log cabin at the top
of the hill, and talk to myself. And I was always aware of the audience
to my thoughts, to my stories. Actually now that I think of it, there
was no audience: my dad was working at his little office down the hill,
my mom at the piano, or driving my sister to and from some errand. It
felt like it was just me, alone in Glen Ellen, thinking up fantastical
stories about Eddie the Cat or the aliens in Heræl or some third
thing.</p>
<p>And when I wrote nonfiction, I would write journal-style entries —
always beginning with the time. I was obsessed with time. It’s 5:48 P.M.
on Sunday, May 16, 2021. I was obsessed with thinking about how right
now was now, and then immediately it became then. I can’t believe that
it used to be 2009. That was the year! That was as far as humanity
progressed! That was the present, that was new, that was the frontier of
our knowledge. Which is crazy because today 2009 seems so so so old. It
both scares me and excites me that someday we will feel the same way
about 2021.</p>
<p>I never met my grandfather, my dad’s dad. He was born just outside of
Berlin in 1923 as Helmut Schönbach, to a rich, secular Jewish family.
They left Germany in 1933, just after Jews were kicked out of the Berlin
public schools. Went to Palestine, spent four years there. I don’t know
why they eventually left, but I suspect the hard farming life didn’t
suit at least my great-grandmother, who was used to the luxury of High
German life. In Palestine, the children changed their names to Hebrew
ones. Helmut became Uriel. His three siblings (Erika, Paul, and little
brother George) also changed their names, but preferred their German
ones and soon switched back. Uri liked Uriel — one of the archangels —
so he kept it for the rest of his life. Ashkenazi Jews have a tradition
of naming their children after dead relatives, which is why I am Gabriel
Bernard. Gabriel, like the archangel, after Uri. Bernard, after my
mother’s uncle — big New York City fashion designer whose obituary in
the New York Times gave my dad an excuse to call up my mother again
after so many years apart.</p>
<p>One night in high school, my friends and I made little holes near the
top of dozens of Red Solo cups and tied them to the strings of helium
balloons, so when you let go the balloons would float to the ceiling and
the cups would hang, suspended, about 6 feet off the floor. We got
really high and spent the night throwing little chocolate candies into
the cups from increasingly far away.</p>
<p>Uri’s mother, Lotte Schönbach, kept a detailed memoir of their escape
from Germany and their refugee years. I read it every few years whenever
I get anxious that I don’t care enough about my family history. She
writes about a harrowing train ride back through Germany in 1937, when
they are trying to make their way to the U.K. to board a ship to
America. They were sharing a compartment with an older German man in a
green jacket — not Jewish — who was trying to keep little George
entertained when some Nazi officers came through the compartment
checking papers. He lied through his teeth to those S.S. officers, kept
my family on their path through time.</p>
<p>A lot of people don’t realize how beautiful VCR players are on the
inside. All it takes is a screwdriver to pry open the black outer frame
and you’ll expose a bright green motherboard, peppered with silver
wiring and electrodes. I would plop myself down on the white carpeted
floor of the living room and completely dissasseble these now-ancient
bits of technology, use a small point-and-shoot camera to take slightly
blurry pictures of the inside structures. It’s worth it if you ever have
a free afternoon.</p>
<p>Little George Schönbach is still little now, but it’s because he’s 90
years old. He was the first programmer my dad ever met. He lives in San
Francisco and goes folk-dancing every week. He offered to take me on a
months-long journey to Croatia the summer I was 12, to go folk-dancing.
I said no.</p>
<p>It was almost 12 years ago, to the day, that my cat Eddie died. May
5, 2009. He was a beautiful, wise, old, long-haired black cat, who would
show up outside the sliding-glass door every single time I cried. We
slept together most nights, and I would wake up to him sleeping on my
chest, nuzzled into my neck or drooling on my pillow. Actually we both
would drool on my pillow. Before he died, he went away for a few days.
On his last night, he came back. My dad found him struggling to climb up
the porch stairs to our front door. My parents carried him up to my room
and laid him on my chest one last time.</p>
<p>Uri Schönbach was sick with brain cancer for almost 20 years. He
passed away before I was born, but not before taking his children to see
MLK’s March on Washington and KKK rallies in D.C. — to show them how
great and how terrible America could be. My grandmother Carrie remarried
a man named Joseph Levine, the wise rabbi who would call me the “young
man with three grandfathers.” He also coined the term the “Log Palace”
to describe that beautiful cabin on the hill. That’s the hill on which
we buried Eddie, with Joseph there to bang his drum and sing the
Mourner’s Kaddish as we wrapped my cherished cat in blankets. Every day
after school I would go down to Eddie’s grave and sit by those rocks. It
makes me happy to think that he’s still there.</p>
