### organizing my reading 
[go back ↰](https://gabey.zip)

## idea
Mostly, this is a place for me to keep track of every (academic) piece I've read and enjoyed. Trying to keep this semi-organized by topic. I'll **bold** papers that I want to read imminently and *italicize* works that I haven't fully read but want to eventually.
