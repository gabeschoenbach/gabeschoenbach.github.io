## coding theory
Codes are sets (whose elements are *codewords*) which have a variety of applications — data compression, error correction, cryptography, etc. 
Most of these papers have to do with fingerprinting codes, which can aid anti-piracy enforcement by identifying users who pirate digital content.

* [Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09370)

## watermarking language models 
How can we use cryptographic techniques to ensure that we can distinguish between text coming from an LLM vs. a human? 
How do these techniques connect to steganography, a cryptographic primitive for hiding secret text in ostensibly innocuous covertext?

* [Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974)

## structured encryption
How can we use cryptographic techniques to allow clients to store private data on an untrustworthy server, and allow them to
query their data without their queries or responses being seen by the server?

* [SoK: Plausibly Deniable Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12809)


## differential privacy
A differentially-private algorithm is a randomized function of a dataset whose outputs shouldn't change much whether or not your data is in the dataset.
