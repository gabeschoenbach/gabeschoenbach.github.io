<h2 id="quick-stuff"><a href="#quick-stuff">#</a> quick stuff</h2>
<p>I grew up in Glen Ellen, California, in the heart of Sonoma Valley. I
like to rock climb and run on the Chicago lakefront, though I miss
exploring the mountains back home. I come from a family of musicians and
enjoy playing the piano and the electric bass. I’m obsessed with making
the dumbest possible jokes, as frequently as my friends will allow.</p>
<p>I’m a <a
href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/">first-year PhD
student</a> in the Computer Science department at the University of
Chicago, advised by <a href="https://aloni.net">Aloni Cohen</a>. I’m
interested in using theoretical computer science to tackle problems in
civic life, with an eye towards legal and policy applications.</p>

<p>I’m trying to read widely and figure out what sorts of problems
appeal to me — I like thinking about questions that are easy to state
and hard to solve. I’ve also been interested in the intersection between
theoretical computer science and legal theory. Lately, I’ve been really
inspired by many of the papers from <a
href="https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2023/">FORC</a>. I like
thinking about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graphs</a>
and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">trees</a> and
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partitions</a>,
all of which stem from my work in <a
href="https://mggg.org/gerrybook.html">computational redistricting</a>.
I’m trying to work through Spielman’s <a
href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sagt/sagt.pdf">Spectral
and Algebraic Graph Theory</a> textbook, and am also getting interested
in steganography and watermarking for large language models.</p>
<p>Before starting my PhD, I spent two years at the <a
href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/">MGGG Redistricting Lab</a> at
Tufts University, working with <a
href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/">Dr. Moon Duchin</a> to connect
the academic study of computational redistricting with real-world
applications. Many of my past papers and projects stem from that
work.</p>

<p>I’m shamelessly copying <a href="https://www.kunalmarwaha.com">Kunal
Marwaha</a>’s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and
easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my
research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be
natural to host online.</p>
