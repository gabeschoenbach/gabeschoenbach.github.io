<h2 id="quick-stuff"><a href="#quick-stuff">#</a> quick stuff</h2>
<p>I grew up in Glen Ellen, California, in the heart of Sonoma Valley. I
like to rock climb and run on the Chicago lakefront, though I miss
exploring the mountains back home. I come from a family of musicians and
enjoy playing the piano and the electric bass. I’m obsessed with making
the dumbest possible jokes, as frequently as my friends will allow.</p>
<p>I’m a <a
href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/">second-year PhD
student</a> in the Computer Science department at the University of
Chicago, advised by <a href="https://aloni.net">Aloni Cohen</a>. I’m
interested in using theoretical computer science to tackle problems in
civic life, with an eye towards legal and policy applications.</p>

<p>I like thinking about questions that are easy to state and hard to
solve. I’ve been interested in the intersection between theoretical
computer science and legal theory. I also like thinking about
combinatorial questions about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graphs</a>,
in particular those about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">trees</a> and
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partitions</a>,
all of which stem from my work in <a
href="https://mggg.org/gerrybook.html">computational redistricting</a>.
I’m also getting interested in steganography and watermarking for large
language models.</p>
<p>Before starting my PhD, I spent two years at the <a
href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/">MGGG Redistricting Lab</a> at
Tufts University, working with <a
href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/">Dr. Moon Duchin</a> to connect
the academic study of computational redistricting with real-world
applications. Many of my past papers and projects stem from that
work.</p>

<p>I’m shamelessly copying <a href="https://www.kunalmarwaha.com">Kunal
Marwaha</a>’s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and
easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my
research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be
natural to host online.</p>
