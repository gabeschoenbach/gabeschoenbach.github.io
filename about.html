<h2 id="quick-stuff"><a href="#quick-stuff">#</a> quick stuff</h2>
<p>I grew up in Glen Ellen, California, in the heart of Sonoma Valley. I
like to rock climb and run on the Chicago lakefront, though I miss
exploring the mountains back home. I come from a family of musicians and
enjoy playing the piano and the electric bass. I’m obsessed with making
the dumbest possible jokes, as frequently as my friends will allow.</p>
<p>I’m a <a
href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/gabe-schoenbach/">first-year PhD
student</a> in the Computer Science department at the University of
Chicago, advised by <a href="https://aloni.net">Aloni Cohen</a>. I’m
interested in using theoretical computer science to tackle problems in
civic life, with an eye towards legal and policy applications.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about deletion-as-control, differential
privacy, and graph-theoretic cryptography. I’m trying to read widely and
figure out what sorts of problems appeal to me.</p>

<p>I’m shamelessly copying <a href="https://www.kunalmarwaha.com">Kunal
Marwaha</a>’s format and style, because I appreciate a minimal and
easy-to-update website. I hope to make this place a repository for my
research ideas, scattered thoughts, and any other project that would be
natural to host online.</p>
